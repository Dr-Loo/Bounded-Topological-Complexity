# Bounded Topological Complexity in Classical Chaos
## From the Norton Dome to the Double Pendulum

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete theoretical framework, numerical implementations, and experimental protocols for the **Bounded Topological Complexity (BTC) theory** and its realization as the **Periodic Table of Chaos**.

We demonstrate that chaotic systems exhibit *system-specific maximal complexity* (C_max) that cannot be exceeded regardless of parameter variation, contradicting the common assumption that increasing energy monotonically increases dynamical complexity. This discovery enables a Mendeleev-style classification of dynamical systems as "elements" with predictable properties and reactions.

## 🔬 Key Discoveries

### **1. Bounded Complexity**
- **Double pendulum (4H1):** C_max = 39.3 ± 2.1 (measured)
- **Lorenz system (3D2):** C_max = 8.2 (measured)
- **Norton dome (0N0):** C_max = 0 (null element)
- **Universal scaling:** ν ≈ 0.26 (Hamiltonian), ν ≈ 0.5 (dissipative)

### **2. The Four Powers Framework**
Chaotic systems are governed by four field powers:
- **Topological (H¹):** Architecture of phase space exploration
- **Geometric (τ):** Local twisting/shearing of trajectories
- **Symbolic (S_sheaf):** Transition freedom in symbolic dynamics
- **Interaction (V):** Coupling capacity (valency)

### **3. Periodic Table of Chaos**
A complete classification scheme organizing chaotic systems by:
- Topological dimension (n)
- Symmetry class (Hamiltonian, Dissipative, etc.)
- Maximal complexity (C_max)
- Scaling exponent (ν)
- Valency (V)

### **4. Reaction Chemistry**
Predictive rules for coupling chaotic systems:
- Valency conservation: V_A + V_B → V_coupled = V_A + V_B - 2k
- Complexity addition: C_coupled = C_A + C_B + C_interaction
- Forbidden reactions identified
